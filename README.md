# Analytics Portfolio
This repository hosts my portfolio containing data analysis projects, done with a mix of code in R, Python, and SQL.
These projects have been completed over the course of my studies at the University of Oregon in Graduate School, and in my professional career as a Data Analyst at Lithia Motors & Driveway.
